# AI_BOT_STREET_FIGHTER



# DESCRIPTION
The project consists of creating an AI to play Street Fighter 2, which will be done by developing Machine Learning algorithms to train it on how to play and win the game, since the training will be about taking the right decisions (moves, attacks..etc) depending on the environment (health, opponent, location..etc), Reinforcement Learning is the optimal way to achieve that goal.  
The focus should be on optimizing the algorithms by choosing the best attributes to consider in the learning environment, as well as the right policies and rewards for each action.  
The development process will be mainly done in Python, in addition to other technologies such as Gym Retro, which is an OpenAI environment for Reinforcement Learning that comes with about 1000 retro games, including Street Fighter 2.
