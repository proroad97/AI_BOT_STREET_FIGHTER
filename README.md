# AI_BOT_STREET_FIGHTER
> pls add projetc description and structure
May be, start by looking at the game files. Findout how characters behave then replace it with our logic

> pls try to think where you will get this street fighter game
Torrent! 

> what dataset to build


> what is gaming logic etc.
Character A: key(action) - if hits(Character B) - reward

> is it classification? object detection ? tracking ?
I think it's Object detection. 

> as this project is not particularly easy we need to touch base soon !!!

# DESCRIPTION
The project consists of creating an AI to play Street Fighter 2, which will be done by developing Machine Learning algorithms to train it on how to play and win the game, since the training will be about taking the right decisions (moves, attacks..etc) depending on the environment (health, opponent, location..etc), Reinforcement Learning is the optimal way to achieve that goal.  
The focus should be on optimizing the algorithms by choosing the best attributes to consider in the learning environment, as well as the right policies and rewards for each action.  
The development process will be mainly done in Python, in addition to other technologies such as Gym Retro, which is an OpenAI environment for Reinforcement Learning that comes with about 1000 retro games, including Street Fighter 2.
