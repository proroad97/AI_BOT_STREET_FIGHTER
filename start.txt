1)The game will run on the simulator snes9x-x64. We download the rom of the game(Street Fighter II Turbo ).
2) We download the application WinSize2 which we will open the game's windows on a prefixed size and position everytime(Download the zip,run the winsize32update.exe and after that we just adjust the sizes and we press ctrl+alt+z ONLY ONE TIME. winsize run on the background so no need for opening)
3)You should find the coordinates where your windows run on your PC ,so be able to capture the game.
